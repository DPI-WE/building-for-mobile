[Read up here for full instructions with examples for lesson writing.](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/3-how-to-write-a-lesson)

## Heading 1

Use `##` second or greater level headings (HTML `<h2>` and greater).

### Heading 1.1

Reference images from the `assets/` folder like so:

```
![](assets/example-image.png)
```

You can use the path `/assets/my-image.png` or `assets/my-image.png`, both will render in your local markdown preview; and when you connect the repository with a Learn Lesson, the assets will upload to Cloudinary and the paths will automatically be converted to a hosted URL, e.g.:

```
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/[CLOUD_NAME]/image/upload/[IMAGE_VERSION]/appdev-lessons/[REPO_NAME]/[BRANCH]/[IMAGE_NAME])
```
